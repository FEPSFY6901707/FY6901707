<h1><b> Abstract</b></h1>

This article explores how the differernt and unique ways that engineers approach problems has shaped past, present, and future ideas of interstella travel over the last 63 years of space exploration from the Soviet's Sputnik 1 (April 12 1961) to Space X's Falcon 9 (November 26 2024)

<h1><b> Article</b></h1>


The evolution of rocket engines traces humanity's journey from early concepts of propulsion to sophisticated systems driving modern space exploration. Early engines relied on gunpowder in simple solid rockets, used for military purposes. Innovations during the 20th century, such as Robert Goddard's development of liquid-fueled rockets, laid the foundation for spacecraft like the Saturn V that powered the Apollo moon landings. The advent of hybrid engines combined features of liquid and solid propulsion for increased versatility.In recent decades, advancements have focused on efficiency, sustainability, and extended mission capabilities. Electric propulsion systems, such as ion and Hall-effect thrusters, emerged as a game-changer, providing low-thrust, high-efficiency options ideal for long-duration missions. Experimental engines like aerospike designs aim to optimize thrust at varying altitudes, and novel concepts, such as plasma and nuclear propulsion, hold promise for interplanetary travel. Green propellants are also gaining traction to mitigate environmental concerns. Institutions like NASA, ESA, and academic centers are driving innovation while reflecting on historical achievements. These breakthroughs bridge past milestones with the future's visionary goals, including interstellar travel, showcasing the transformative potential of propulsion technology. As rocket engines evolve, they remain central to humanity’s pursuit of the stars.
