<h1><b> Abstract</b></h1>

This article tests if computer simulation is useful in the industry today, and questions why it is integral to engineers, scientists, and programmers. This article dives into the use of MATLAB to simulate and calculate the efficiency of an internal combustion engine, simulating virtual car crashes, the use of real-world data to help these algorithms, and the use of this data in other industries such as game development.

<h1><b> Article</b></h1>

In the shipping industry, the efficiency of the main engines used in ships are integral in ship operations. Inefficient engines cost the company time and money. Additionally, due to the unprecedented rise in fuel prices, and international pressure to limit emissions due to environmental concern, reducing wasted energy is extremely important in maintaining the sustainability of the shipping industry. Various systems have been already put in place to either increase engine efficiency, or to make use of wasted energy which has been output by the engine. However, testing these systems is extremely expensive, so computer modelling is essential in this industry to test prototypes and find new ways to increase useful output energy in marine engines. Computer models are useful in cases where predicting the real engines combustion phase with measuring instruments is hard. Using physics equations to simulate the gas pressure, temperature and energy output of an engine allows the engineer to predict how the engine is working, and what is causing the inefficiency of an engine, without having to do expensive testing, while not compromising on accuracy. Multiple engine models have been combined to create a more accurate simulation of a marine engine using MATLAB and SIMULINK. This creates an accurate representation of a real life engine, with inputs, outputs and internals. As seen in figure 1, using this new model accurately predicts the measurements obtained from the actual engine, making the model a more cost effective way of measuring the engine, while still being extremely accurate to real life measurements.
